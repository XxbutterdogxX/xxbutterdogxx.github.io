            <p>Taking the number 1 spot is the premiere party pony of Ponyville. Ever since she got her cutie mark as a filly, Pinkie Pie has been a package of boundless, happy energy …kind of surprising if you’ve met the rest of her family. Her pastimes include baking sweets, throwing massively fun parties, breaking out into song, and occasionally breaking the fourth wall. However, she isn’t without her sensitive side when she doesn’t feel wanted …and you don’t want to see her scary side. Despite all that, all Pinkie Pie really wants is to make ponies laugh and see them smile, making her the perfect bearer for the Element of Laughter. Also, NEVER break a Pinkie Promise!</p>

            <h2>Rainbow Dash</h2>
            
            <p>This pony makes the series 20% cooler. Rainbow Dash is a part of Ponyville’s weather patrol and the newest member of her idol flying team – the Wonderbolts. She’s also one of the fastest and most talented fliers in all of Equestria, able to perform the legendary sonic rainboom maneuver. She strides to be the best at what she does, which can make her a little brash and egotistical. However, she’s always there for her friends when they need her – hence why she’s the element of loyalty. She performed her first sonic rainboom as a filly, which helped her and her best friends earn their cutie marks. So, in a way, their friendship is all thanks to Rainbow Dash.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Twilight Sparkle</h2>
            <p>Being the central character of the series, Twilight had to appear SOMEWHERE on this list. At the series’ start, she was just a talented unicorn who would rather keep her muzzle in a book than socialize. However, after her teacher –Princess Celestia- sends her to live in Ponyville, she befriends five ponies she now can’t imagine living without. Though she’s the leader and rational one of the group, she’s prone to panic attacks when stressed. With the help of her new friends, Twilight ultimately goes from a dorky and antisocial unicorn to a social-butterfly A glicorn princess, ready to teach and inspire other ponies with what she’s learned about the magic of friendship… even if she still has trouble flying.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Discord</h2>
            <p>John de Lancie is well known for his role as the all-powerful trickster Q from Star Trek; so imagine if Q was a chaotic creature out of Greek mythology. That is Discord in a nutshell – a draconequus and the master of chaos and disharmony. Originally an antagonist bent on breaking the Mane Six’s friendship, Fluttershy gave him his first real taste of friendship… and made him realize how much it really means to him. While he isn’t a villain anymore, he’s still a mystical prankster who helps in his own… chaotic way. His over-the-top personality makes him feel like the life of the party, but he still has a lot to learn about being a friend.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Fluttershy</h2>
            <p>Be careful of the shy ones, they’ll kill you with cuteness. Fluttershy is a timid Pegasus who prefers living on the ground than up in the clouds. She lives in a cottage close to the forest where she takes care of all kinds of little animals …including Angel, a devil of a bunny. As her name implies, Fluttershy is incredibly shy and shows fear in front of crowds and threatening situations, unfortunately making her a bit of a pushover. Despite that, she is one of the kindest and most empathetic mares you’ll ever meet, yet able to show tough love when needed– making her the bearer for the Element of Kindness. Just beware, don’t get on her bad side.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Apple Jack</h2>
            <p>A farmer at Sweet Apple Acres who is always kept busy bucking apples and keeping the farm in order, Applejack is strong, hardworking, and dependable; but she can also be a little headstrong and stubborn about doing things her way… which usually causes her to quarrel with Rarity. Though she lives with her big brother, little sister, and granny, Applejack’s family is arguably the largest extended family in the series, and she holds all her kinsfolk close to her heart. She is also incapable of lying, unless the situation is desperate, and prefers to live by the gospel truth – earning her the title of the Element of Honesty.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Rarity</h2>
            <p>This mare knows how to add a little style to everything she does, it’s no wonder why Spike loves her. The proprietor of Carousel Boutique with her own fashion franchise expanding across Equestria, Rarity has an eye for detail in her work making every dress unique; skills that often help her outside the boutique if needed. Though she likes to act formal and sophisticated, Rarity can act very overdramatic when distressed… or she just loves the attention. Rarity is never afraid to offer her special brand of help to anyone in need or get her freshly cleaned hooves dirty if need be, earning her the Element of Generosity.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Spike</h2>
            <p>Spike is a baby dragon and the primary male character of the main cast. Having been hatched by Twilight when she was a filly, Spike has since become her best friend and number one assistant – aiding her with any task or chore at hand, and keeping her sanity in check. However, Spike himself is not perfect – he’s shown to make mistakes because he’s so young, but he always tries to make amends for his wrongdoings. Being a dragon living in Ponyville, Spike has struggles with his identity, but has learned what other dragons don’t even try to learn – how to be a friend. He also has a not-so-subtle crush on a certain “somepony.”
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Apple Bloom</h2>
            <p>You may remember this little filly from our cutest animated TV characters video, but now she’s starting off today’s list. Apple Bloom is the younger Apple sibling who usually enjoys her independence– especially from her protective big sister, Applejack. Originally a blank flank, Apple Bloom was determined to finally achieve her cutie mark… maybe a little TOO determined. After making friends with fellow blank flanks Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, she banded together with them to form the Cutie Mark Crusaders – a club devoted to finding their cutie marks. Apple Bloom has the most worries in the group about making her mark, but hey, you know what they say about the journey over the destination!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Sunset Shimmer</h2>
            <p>Once Princess Celestia’s top student, she ran away into the human world and took over Canterlot High School as a bully with an iron fist. However, when she tries to steal Twilight’s crown, said princess and her friends’ human counterparts blast her with the magic of friendship… literally. Since then, she’s gone from a manipulative she-demon, to a sympathetic heroine trying to make up for her past misdeeds. With Princess Twilight back in Equestria, Sunset takes the reigns as leader of the human heroes – helping them control any magical mishaps that pop up, and saving others from following the path her old self took. She had a rocky past, but she won’t let it define her.
