    <h1>Top 10 My Little Pony Characters</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Pinkie Pie</h2>

            <p>Taking the number 1 spot is the premiere party pony of Ponyville. Ever since she got her cutie mark as a filly, Pinkie Pie has been a package of boundless, happy energy …kind of surprising if you’ve met the rest of her family. Her pastimes include baking sweets, throwing massively fun parties, breaking out into song, and occasionally breaking the fourth wall. However, she isn’t without her sensitive side when she doesn’t feel wanted …and you don’t want to see her scary side. Despite all that, all Pinkie Pie really wants is to make ponies laugh and see them smile, making her the perfect bearer for the Element of Laughter. Also, NEVER break a Pinkie Promise!</p>

            <h2>Rainbow Dash</h2>
            <p>This pony makes the series 20% cooler. Rainbow Dash is a part of Ponyville’s weather patrol and the newest member of her idol flying team – the Wonderbolts. She’s also one of the fastest and most talented fliers in all of Equestria, able to perform the legendary sonic rainboom maneuver. She strides to be the best at what she does, which can make her a little brash and egotistical. However, she’s always there for her friends when they need her – hence why she’s the element of loyalty. She performed her first sonic rainboom as a filly, which helped her and her best friends earn their cutie marks. So, in a way, their friendship is all thanks to Rainbow Dash.</p>
